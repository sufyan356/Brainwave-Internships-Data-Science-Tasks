🚀SUPER STORE SALES ANALYSIS🚀

I'm thrilled to be working as a virtual Data Science/Analytics Intern at Brainwave Matrix Solutions. My first task was to analyze the sales data of a commercial store and gain actionable insights from it. 📊

Here’s what I focused on:

🧹 Data Cleaning: Preparing the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring consistency.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing sales trends, identifying top-selling products, and exploring customer behavior.

📈 Insights: Highlighting key patterns in sales performance across different regions and time periods.

This project helped me sharpen my skills in Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
